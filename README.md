The IDK Project Is Cancelled
============================

As [Chef Software](http://www.getchef.com/) themselves have released
a project that IDK was supposed to be, we have concluded that it
doesn't make any sense to continue and try to compete. The
Infrastructure Development Kit project is closed and won't be
maintained or developed.

Please use the [Chef Development Kit](http://www.getchef.com/downloads/chef-dk/) instead.

You can read more about it in
[the official announcement](http://www.getchef.com/blog/2014/04/15/chef-development-kit/)
on the Chef Software's blog.
